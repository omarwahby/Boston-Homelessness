# Modeling Homelessness in the Boston Area
### By Omar Wahby, Katherine Grisanzio, Brent Ruttle, and Aashna Shah

Our project focused on predicting the value of owner-occupied homes in Boston in order to better understand the factors which determine the current level of homelessness in the Boston area.

The factors we used to predict the Boston home prices, abbreviated in the data set as 'MEDV', were:

1. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars
11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT - percent lower status of the population

Analyses were performed in Python. All code is available via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kbomar945/Boston-Homelessness).
