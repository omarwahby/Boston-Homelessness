# Modeling Homelessness in the Boston Area
### By Omar Wahby, Katherine Grisanzio, Brent Ruttle, and Aashna Shah
### *Final Data Science Project*

Our project focused on predicting the value of owner-occupied homes in Boston in order to better understand the factors which determine the current level of homelessness in the Boston area. Our methodology is detailed below:

1. We queried the pre-curated dataset of Boston Housing Data derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.
2. We performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset for US homelessness from 2007-2016 to understand general trends of homelessness for each state, and subsequently concentrated on analyzing homelessness in Boston using the Boston Housing dataset.
3. Finally, we used an array of machine learning models from Python's Scikit-learn machine learning library to develop a model that could predict Boston housing prices with 91% accuracy. 

Analyses were performed in Python. All code is available via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kbomar945/Boston-Homelessness).
